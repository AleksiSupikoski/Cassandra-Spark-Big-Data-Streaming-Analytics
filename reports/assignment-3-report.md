# 1 - Design for streaming analytics 

### 1.1 As a tenant, select a dataset suitable for streaming data analytics as a running scenario. Explain the dataset and why the dataset is suitable for streaming data analytics in your scenario. As a tenant, present at least two different analytics in the interest of the tenant: (i) a streaming analytics (tenantstreamapp) which analyzes streaming data from the tenant and (ii) a batch analytics, using the workflow model, which analyzes historical results outputted by the streaming analytics. The explanation should be at a high level to allow us to understand the data and possible analytics so that, later on, you can implement and use them in answering other questions.

For tenant's dataset i will continue using IoT data from Korkeasaari Zoo tortoises. Their data is continuously generated by IoT -devices attached to turtles providing information on tortoises' behaviour and environment. Their timestamped data can be received as a stream in real time and processed to provide for excample analytics on their environment therefore providing benefit to a tenant who might be concerned on tortoises well being, e.g. make sure that temperature or anything else is out of order at the zoo. Tortoises are demanding creatures regarding their environment, thus real time analytics are required.

Features such as 3D acceleration can be analyzed in real time to analyze movement and behaviour of tortoises in the zoo, in a streaming manner, or recent temperature changes to alert the tenant, while more sophisticated information can be extracted from historical data batch analytics, for example to determine the most movement active tortoises species, or seasonal changes in tortoises activity.

```
time	readable_time	acceleration	acceleration_x	acceleration_y	acceleration_z	battery	humidity	pressure	temperature	dev-id
1522826433358	2018-04-04T07:20:33.358000Z	1009.8237469974649	-104	332	948	3007	20	1009.91	35.24	C2:9A:9F:E5:58:27

```
### 1.2  The tenant will send data through a messaging system, which provides stream data sources. Discuss, explain and give examples for the following aspects for the streaming analytics: (i) should the streaming analytics handle keyed or non-keyed data streams for the tenant data, and (ii) which types of delivery guarantees should be suitable for the stream analytics and why.
