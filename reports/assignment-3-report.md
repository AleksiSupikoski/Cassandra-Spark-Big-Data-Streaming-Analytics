# 1 - Design for streaming analytics 

### 1.1 As a tenant, select a dataset suitable for streaming data analytics as a running scenario. Explain the dataset and why the dataset is suitable for streaming data analytics in your scenario. As a tenant, present at least two different analytics in the interest of the tenant: (i) a streaming analytics (tenantstreamapp) which analyzes streaming data from the tenant and (ii) a batch analytics, using the workflow model, which analyzes historical results outputted by the streaming analytics. The explanation should be at a high level to allow us to understand the data and possible analytics so that, later on, you can implement and use them in answering other questions.

For tenant's dataset i will continue using IoT data from Korkeasaari Zoo tortoises. Their data is continuously generated by IoT -devices attached to turtles providing information on tortoises' behaviour and environment. Their timestamped data can be received as a stream in real time and processed to provide for excample analytics on their environment therefore providing benefit to a tenant who might be concerned on tortoises well being, e.g. make sure that temperature or anything else is out of order at the zoo. Tortoises are demanding creatures regarding their environment, thus real time analytics are required.

Features such as 3D acceleration can be analyzed in real time to analyze movement and behaviour of tortoises in the zoo, in a streaming manner, or recent temperature changes to alert the tenant, while more sophisticated information can be extracted from historical data batch analytics, for example to determine the most movement active tortoises species, or seasonal changes in tortoises activity.

A samle data row:
```
time	readable_time	acceleration	acceleration_x	acceleration_y	acceleration_z	battery	humidity	pressure	temperature	dev-id
1522826433358	2018-04-04T07:20:33.358000Z	1009.8237469974649	-104	332	948	3007	20	1009.91	35.24	C2:9A:9F:E5:58:27

```
### 1.2  The tenant will send data through a messaging system, which provides stream data sources. Discuss, explain and give examples for the following aspects for the streaming analytics: (i) should the streaming analytics handle keyed or non-keyed data streams for the tenant data, and (ii) which types of delivery guarantees should be suitable for the stream analytics and why.

Tenant's dataset contains data with device-ID of the device which produced the data, assuming that we want to have analytics such as presented in 1.1, we would prefer keyed streams in order to group data by the ID's, thus having insight on each separate tortoise. If we didn't care about this type of analytics such as presented in 1.1, and for example only wanted to calculate average temperatures of all the IoT devices at the zoo, we wouldn't care about individual tortoises, and keying stream by device-ID's wouldn't be necessary. If we used non keyed streams and still wanted to provide analytics presented in 1.1 our architecure would then have unnecesary overhead to additionally collect a subset from all the data generated through filtering, with keyed stream, we can work on the subsed upon its arrival.
  
Regarding the delivery guarantees the data is generated every 5 seconds, and regarding the metrics environment and movement having extremely large time-resolution is not that important for the tenant, since environment variables do not change too quicly and tortoises are slow animals. Additionally, very similar data will be produced with the next timestamp, so it can be easily extrapolated in between, since fields of such IoT data remain the same we can safely let the broker drop the packages. Therefore *at most once* for delivery guarantee is suitable. At least once would produce a little additional overhead on message acknowledgement and we would have to bother to remove dublicates based on timestamp (for example if we didnt do that and tosrtoise acceleration was at that moment high if it was falling, and the message was dublica the calculated average acceleration for 10 seconds woudl be incorrect), exactly once produces even more overhed wich is not necessary for our data.
  
### 1.3 Given streaming data from the tenant (selected before). Explain the following issues: (i) which types of time should be associated with stream data sources for the analytics and be considered in stream processing (if the data sources have no timestamps associated with events, then what would be your solution), (ii) which types of windows should be developed for the analytics (if no window, then why), (iii) what could cause out-of-order data/records with your selected data in your running example, and (iv) will watermarks be needed or not, explain why. Explain these aspects and give examples.

The dataset provides two times "time" time in tenants own standard and "readable" time in a generally accepted standard. Both of them represent the time, when the data was generated, so we can use it as a timestamp. For performance analytics we can use that timestamp and calculate the latency of message broker and consumer by associating a row with another time stamp upon receival. If the data source didn't have any timestamp we would need to assume latency separately and add it in processing stage: current-time - latency = approximate time of data generated, but designer needs to remember tahat delivery guarantee of exatctly once would be more suitable here.
  
Depending on the knowledge that we want to extract from the data we might want or not to use windowing. For example if we want to extract average temperature or any other metric over a period of time we could use a sliding window of 5 minutes to gather data and calculate averages for the metrics. If we want to stream instantaneous movement data of the tortoise, then there is no use of windowing. 

Device malfunction or network issues or prblems in mysimbdp could result in data to be sent/received out of order. This will create problems on data processing side, especially if the data didnt have any timestamp, resulting in incomplete data processing. Luckily the data has timestamps, so we can counter these issues on processing stage.
  
When creating a time window a watermark on the data is used to collect the data based on data's timestamp, not the system time of the data processor, this is not only smarter since we have a timestamp in the data, but it will also help to counter problems mentioned above. 
```
    df \
    .withWatermark("readable_time", "1 minutes") \
    .groupBy(window("readable_time", "1 minutes"), "dev_id") \
    ...
```
